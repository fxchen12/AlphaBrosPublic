6.470 Milestone 2
=================

1. We're changing the target segment (from Question 3) to adults 18 and older. This makes sense, given the fact that we are college students and this allows the target segment to include most of our peers (helpful for user testing, market research, etc.) Also, it is the scope of the CDC study referenced in Milestone 1.
<BR>Additionally, there is no more timer in our application (Question 2 and Question 4). Furthermore, regarding Question 4, we would add steps to the use case involving viewing progress and achievements.
<BR>As far as the MVP section, we're abandoning the idea of reminders for exercise (Question 1). Goal setting and tracking and achievements will be available in the MVP (Question 2). We will still have a few exercises available for a default user, as stated in Question 3, but will also allow users to define exercises.
<BR> As far as the Additional Questions, Keanu is registered for credit, and Austin and Francis are not.
