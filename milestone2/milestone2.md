6.470 Milestone 2
=================

1. We're changing the target segment (from Question 3) to adults 18 and older. This makes sense, given the fact that we are college students and this allows the target segment to include most of our peers (helpful for user testing, market research, etc.) Also, it is the scope of the CDC study referenced in Milestone 1.
<BR>Additionally, there is no more timer in our application (Question 2 and Question 4). Furthermore, regarding Question 4, we would add steps to the use case involving viewing progress and achievements.
<BR>As far as the MVP section, we're abandoning the idea of reminders for exercise (Question 1). Goal setting and tracking and achievements will be available in the MVP (Question 2). We will still have a few exercises available for a default user, as stated in Question 3, but will also allow users to define exercises.
<BR> Regarding the Additional Questions, Keanu is registered for credit, and Austin and Francis are not.

2. Dashboard: The dashboard is implemented in terms of critical functionalities (workout creation and deletion). It should have excerpts from the goals and progress sections (not implemented) in the final submission. It is possible to choose which workout to use across the Dashboard, Goals, and Progress sections.
<BR>Goals: Goal setting and tracking is implemented, requiring only minor aesthetic improvements. Goals are filtered by current workout.
<BR>Progress: Some progress data is available on the Progress page in a very basic table. We've also managed to create a bar graph of 10 day workout history by duration. This demonstrates that we have the framework in place for some very interesting data visualizations.
<BR>Achievements: We have 42 achievements with completion tracking and display both working properly.
<BR>In terms of general functionality, our registration and login systems are working properly, as well as settings functionalities.

3. In general, except for the changes to our plans mentioned in Question 1, we are on schedule in terms of implementing our MVP.

4. We would like to implement many more graphs and achievements, for which the back end framework is already in place. Additionally, we would like to generally improve flow and aesthetics across the site.

5. Ruby on Rails

6. jQuery (For more details on libraries etc. for 5 and 6, see the Gemfile and docs/sources.txt)

7. Firefox

8. Generally, the presentation of our site must be flawless in terms of efficiency and aesthetics. It is not quite there yet. Only an extremely pleasant user interface will effectively distinguish our site in terms of usability.
