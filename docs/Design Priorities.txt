1. Clean - Not busy, just enough information displayed.
2. Easy to navigate - not a lot of menus or things to read. Should feel natural to navigate without a lot of clicking or searching.
3. Modern - Let's stay away from the 2000's (ex: bodybuilder.com). I'm feeling something html5 style, but not too in your face. Too many fullscreen pages make me feel claustrophobic. I guess we need to find a comfortable mix.
4. The fewer pages the better. (with the exception of the searchable tutorial and workout pages). 
5. Someone should be able to bookmark one page and have it be the central hub. I want some page to be the "dashboard" so to speak.
