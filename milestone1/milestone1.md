User Research
-------------

1. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, about 80% of adults in America fail to regularly exercise as much as government experts recommend. The recommended amounts are in fact relatively small--2.5 hours at moderate intensity and 0.25 at high intensity.

We hypothesize that this problem does not reflect a lack of free time. It also likely is not caused by lack of knowledge about the benefits of exercise. We believe that this issue is a consequence of the difficulty of forming habits. Our site seeks to help people form exercise habits. It will be simple, intuitive, and rewarding.

2. According to "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, a habit consists of a cue, a routine, and a reward. Our application will have features that effectively address all three.

Habit forming necessarily makes use of existing cues and involves changes in routine, according to Duhigg. Our application will take advantage of the cues related to having a solid schedule \(something well understood by most Americans\). We will allow people to schedule regular exercise and configure reminders to associate existing cues with exercise.

We will also facilitate an exercise routine. Our fundamental approach to doing so involves a user dashboard that offers various types of exercise. A user will easily be able to select a type of exercise. For that type, the user will be able to start, stop, and adjust a timer to record duration of exercise. Optionally, the user may choose to record other statistics as distance, weight, etc.

In order to reward users, we will display cumulative exercise accomplishments using a variety of graphs and charts. These will be designed to emphasize accumulation of time, distance, etc. Additionally, we will offer various achievements.

We hope that our site will help to motivate people by showing them their ability to improve. In order to facilitate this, we will have possibly have a goal setting and tracking system.

3. The target segment basically includes the subsets of the population that need more regular exercise. According to the CDC study referenced above, adults 25 and older are generally less likely to exercise sufficiently. Thus, this is the target segment for our product.

4. A typical use case is demonstrated in the list below. In this use case, a new user is attempting to create and utilize an exercise routine of walking for 30 minutes per day. Here are the essential steps:

a. User accesses home page through root address, server loads home page \(which includes account creation form\).

b. User fills out and submits account creation form, server sends welcome email and displays dashboard.

c. User clicks on "Goals" on dashboard, then clicks "New Goal", server provides user with a form to specify details.

d. User fills out form (requesting daily reminders) and submits form, server saves the goal in the database and schedules reminder emails to be sent. Server returns user to dashboard, reporting successful goal creation.

e. User clicks on "Exercises" on dashboard, then locates "Walking" and clicks "Start Exercise." Server starts timer app.

f. User finishes exercise and clicks "Stop." Server displays workout details and offers ability to edit before saving.

g. User confirms details, server saves workout history to database and returns user to exercise panel.

Minimal Viable Product
----------------------

1. User account creation, logging in, and logging out will be implemented. Additionally, users will be able to manually enter and adjust times for completed exercise routines. They will also be able to set repeated reminders for exercise. Finally, they will be able to view at least one progress graph or chart. These features cover the essential features necessary for habit forming through the site.

We plan to assess and address security concerns for the MVP.

2. The timer does not have to be in the MVP. Additionally, goal setting, additional graphs, and achievements do not have to be in the MVP. Though these features would enormously benefit usability, they are not functionally critical.

3. We will have a few exercises available. Additionally, there will be planned stylistic improvements between the MVP and final product.
